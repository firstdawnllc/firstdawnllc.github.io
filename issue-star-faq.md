### How can I find issues that I have added to a favorites list?
You can use Jira's standard search feature to find Issues that you have added to your personal favorites lists. 

To get started with the necessary JQL, open the Issue Star app, and then click the `View all your marked issues` link:
![issue-star-view-all-marked-issues](/assets/issue-star-view-all-marked-issues.png)

You should be directed to the default Jira search view. Now, click the `Configure Columns` button on the right hand side of the screen so that the `issue_star_object` column renders in your results:
