### How can I pin a comment?
You can pin a comment in two ways:

1. **Using the Pinned Comments Issue Activity.**
    - Open the `Pinned Comments` Issue Activity by clicking on the `Pinned Comments` button towards the bottom of your Issue. (Depending on your screen width, the button may be rendered as part of drop down menu).
    - Find the comment you'd like to pin, and then click `Pin Comment`.

2. **Using the comment's ID or link.**
    - Open the `Pinned Comments` app by clicking on its icon in the app ribbon at the top of the issue.
    - Then - in the regular comments section at the bottom of the Issue - copy the link to the comment you'd like to pin (look for the link icon that appears when you hover near the time stamp).
    - Finally, paste the link into the form that renders in the `Pinned Comments` app and hit `Pin`.
