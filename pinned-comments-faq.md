### How can I pin a comment?
The easiest way to pin a comment is using the Pinned Comments Issue Activity:

#### Pinning a Comment Using the Pinned Comments Issue Activity
- Open the `Pinned Comments` Issue Activity by clicking on the `Pinned Comments` button towards the bottom of your Issue. (Depending on your screen width, the button may be rendered as part of drop down menu).
- Find the comment you'd like to pin, and then click `Pin Comment`.

Alternatively, you can pin a comment using the comment's ID or link:

#### Alternate Option: Pinning a Comment Using Its ID Or Link

- Open the `Pinned Comments` app by clicking on its icon in the app ribbon at the top of the issue.
- Then - in the regular comments section at the bottom of the Issue - copy the link to the comment you'd like to pin (look for the link icon that appears when you hover near the time stamp).
- Finally, paste the link into the form that renders in the `Pinned Comments` app and hit `Pin`.

### How can I view pinned comments?

You can view pinned comments in one of three places - use whichever is most convenient for you.

#### 1. View Pinned Comments Under the Issue Description

One place you can view pinned comments is under the issue description:

#### 2. View Pinned Comments To the Right of the Issue

A second place you can view pinned comments in the issue context box to the right of your issue:

#### 3. View Pinned Comments Next to Regular Comments

A third place you can view pinned comments is in a dedicated issue activity at the bottom of your issue (next to regular comments):
